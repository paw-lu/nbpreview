A terminal viewer for Jupyter notebooks.
It's like [cat](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/cat.1.html) for ipynb files.

## Documentation

nbpreview's [documentation] contains
a detailed breakdown of its [features],
[command-line usage][usage],
and [instructions on how to configure][configure] the tool.

<!-- installation-start -->

## Quick look

Want to just see how nbpreview would render an output on your terminal?
Use [uv] to get a preview.
The snippet below installs uv
(if not already in your system)
and uses it to render a notebook stored in this repository.

```console
% curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
% curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/paw-lu/nbpreview/refs/heads/main/docs/example_notebook_cells/hero_notebook.ipynb | uvx nbpreview
```

## Installation

nbpreview can be installed through any of the major python package managers
(eg [uv], [pipx], or [pip] from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/)).

[uv] is the easiest way to get started,
[there are multiple ways to install it](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/).
(Such as the example snippet above using curl).

```console
% uv tool install nbpreview
```

nbpreview may also be installed via [pip] if you prefer:

```console
% python -m pip install nbpreview
```

[pipx]: https://pypa.github.io/pipx/
[pip]: https://pip.pypa.io/
[uv]: https://docs.astral.sh/uv/

### Complimentary tools

<!-- complimentary-tools-start -->

If you're interested in complimentary tools
that help improve the terminal experience for notebooks,
there are many amazing projects out there.

- **[bat](https://github.com/sharkdp/bat)**
  is not a tool for notebooks specifically.
  But similar to nbpreview,
  it provides a rich output for many types of files on the terminal,
  and is the primary inspiration for nbpreview.
- **[euporie]**
  is a really exciting project
  that allows you to edit and run Jupyter notebooks on the terminal.
- **[nbclient]**
  is a library for executing notebooks from the command line.
- **[nbpreview]**
  is another project that coincidentally shares a name with this one.
  It allows for Jupyter notebooks to be rendered
  without running a notebook server.
- **[nbqa]**
  allows the use of linters and formatters on notebooks.
  It's also used by this project.
- **[jpterm]**
  is and up-and-coming successor to [nbterm]
  which will be accompanied by a web client.
  Looking forward to seeing this develop.
- **[nbtermix]**
  is an actively-developed fork of [nbterm].
- **[nbterm]**
  lets you edit and execute Jupyter Notebooks on the terminal.
- **[papermill]**
  allows the parameterization and execution of Jupyter Notebooks.

## Credits

<!-- credits-start -->

nbpreview relies on a lot of fantastic projects.
Check out the [dependencies] for a complete list of libraries that are leveraged.

Besides the direct dependencies,
there are some other projects that directly enabled the development of nbpreview.

- **[bat]**
  is not explicitly used in this project,
  but served as the primary inspiration.
  This projects strives to be [bat]â€”but
  for notebooks.
  Many of nbpreview's features and command-line options are directly adopted from [bat].
- **[Hypermodern Python Cookiecutter]**
  is the template this project was generated on.
  It is a fantastic project that integrates [Poetry],
  [Nox],
  and [pre-commit].
  It's responsible for most of this project's CI.
- **[justcharts]**
  is directly used by this project
  to generate the Vega and Vega-Lite charts.
